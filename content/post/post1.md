title: "Social Media File Sharing and Security"
---

Social media companies are advertising about security and safety, and I am not doubting their security. But can you share your bank account number and password using social media app, even the safest one. Trust me, never do that. Social media can see you data at any time, law enforcement actually can ask them to show your data.

Another thing that I am worried about these companies is, they are storing and running analytics on our data (Even Encrypted Data Headers). Because it's their business, to manipulate us. At EncryptGig we are trying to make an effort to avoid all these and to make sure, whenever you share data, you are allowed to separate security and data sharing.
To see how we do that, you can try for free our free encryptgig [product](https://app.encryptgig.com/EncryptFile).
