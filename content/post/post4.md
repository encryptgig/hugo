GDPR law has caused many MNCs to store customer’s data locally within EU boundaries. 
If companies, choose not to follow the order they are being penalized with the hefty amount, 
and jeopardizing the business. Sooner or later, India, China, Singapore, 
and other Asian nations would also be thinking to implement customized data protection law as per their land. 
Simply put, encryption will be a powerful weapon and guardian of data stored either on a private data center or cloud. 
Undoubtedly, now is a good time for organizations to implement encryption products and stay ahead of competitors.
