The CIA Trilogy of confidentiality, integrity and availability is core of information security.
Most of the security solutions are revolving around these concepts.

### What Is Confidentiality ?

Our [Solution](https://app.encryptgig.com/EncryptFile) can help individuals and organizations to achieve Confidentiality.
Confidentiality means protecting the information from unintended or unauthorized access, or some kind of misuse.
Every stored information has some kind of sensitivity. 
The more sensitive is the information, more valuable it becomes.
Hackers are always in hunt for such information, and they try to atack information systems for
- passwords
- credit card numbers
- bank account numbers etc.

Hackers can launch many kinds of attacks to access this information.
So, in an information system the data visibility, and it's access must be protected and using encryption is one of the best 
method to do that. [Encrypgig](https://app.encryptgig.com/EncryptFile) has a free product that can help to achieve Confidentiality.


###  What is Integrity ?

The encrypted data must be protected from alteration. It means, if Bob sends a File to Alan it's the responsibility of
the transport mechanism and the information system, that is there in place to send correct and accurate information to Alan.
Hackers can alter the data and may cause serious issues. For e.g., let's see this communication between Alan and Bob.

````
Alan: HI 
Bob: Hello
Alan: Please send me my package at Address A
Bob: OK
````
Now BOB sends this package to Alan, but consider a case where Hacker modifies the information in between and
changes the address from:
````
Address A to Address B , Address B is Hacker's address.
````
Now the package goes to Hacker instead of Alan. So, that is why data integrity is important.
The integrity of data in an information system is based on the method used for encryption.
Our [product](https://app.encryptgig.com/EncryptFile) in encryptgig is carefully designed to 
server integrity.


### Availability

The protected data must be available to authorized users and [encryptgig solution](https://app.encryptgig.com/EncryptFile)
not only encrypts the data but, it also provides granular levek of access control. Where you can allow and disallow
users to access data dynamically.
