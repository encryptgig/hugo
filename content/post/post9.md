### Just biometric-based authentication is sufficient for data security?

Retinas, irises, voices, and fingerprints-based authentication are widely accepted across payments, mobile, and applications industries.  
Unfortunately, many perceived biometric as the only security standard that they can rely on for security. The truth is biometric authentication 
doesnâ€™t protect the plain data that are stored on mobiles, computers, and servers.  When hackers get the access of such data and if start exploiting, 
it catastrophized the reputation of organization and individuals alike. So, what is the solution to this problem? Well, encrypting data all the time 
and giving the decryption access only to the right person, could certainly maximize the data security and aid in preventing the damage at the surface itself. 
Not to mention, also increases customer trust and the reputation of organizations. At EncryptGig, you can leverage your encryption capability exponentially 
just with a point of click. Try out our product- [encryptgig](https://app.encryptgig.com/EncryptFile)
