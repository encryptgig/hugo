**I trust my wife with my life but, do I trust her with my computer or phone ?**

This question is funny, but it is pointing to a really serious problem these days. Data stored in your computer and mobile
ca be sensitive and everyone is not supposed to see it. I call it as common man's problem of data security.

The concept of data security is not new for enterprise or organizations, but for common man it's still of no value. The 
common man shouts when some of his money is stolen from bank or email is hacked or his personal photos or videos are compromised.

In this post, [encryptgig](https://app.encryptgig.com/EncryptFile) will explain the basic concepts of data security to common man.
Assume your data is your gold, and you want to keep it somewhere safe. So, where are you going to keep it ? 

Of course, you will keep it some place safe and locked. May be inside locker or in a high security safe and ofcourse that safe will be
physically strong. Now, the same way you keep your gold in a safe you need to keep some of your data safely. By data, I mean
- Your Passwords
- Some personnel videos
- or Some important digital documents

For keeping them safe there are multiple options, 
- keep them on computer protected with passwords
- keep them on cloud
- keep them in emails

These options are good but, have you ever thought:
- what if computer is hacked ?
- cloud account is hacked ?
- email is hacked ?

or another way of looking at this is:
- if I gave my data to someone else, can they see it ?

There are multiple possible questions, when it comes to data security. The one answer that encryptgig can give you here is, **Encrypt Your Data**,
