Blockchain is on the boom and is getting huge traction from individuals, organizations, and even investors all over the world. But when it comes to securing transactions of the ledgers, it becomes extremely difficult to track since nodes are distributed across the countries. Wouldn’t it be nice if every node in the blockchain maintains its own data security with its own cryptographic algorithm, and still nods can talk to each other seamlessly?
