The massive growth of IoT devices has introduced a new set of data protection challenges. For example, webcams are capturing and storing video feeds continuously. What if thieves get access to the webcam hard drive and watch the videos? It sounds dangerous at first. Encryptgig has a solution to this problem. Our product offers encryption at the edge for any IoT devicesâ€™ local storage. What it means, now IoT devices can store videos with encrypted form, hence no matter who accesses them- only an authorized person can decrypt the original videos.
